Hackerrank problem: Say "Hello, World!" With Python

Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:
```
𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚝("𝙷𝚎𝚕𝚕𝚘, 𝚆𝚘𝚛𝚕𝚍!")
```

You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:
```
𝚖𝚢_𝚜𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐 = "𝙷𝚎𝚕𝚕𝚘, 𝚆𝚘𝚛𝚕𝚍!"
𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚝(𝚖𝚢_𝚜𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐)
```
The above code will print Hello, World! on your screen. Try it yourself in the editor below!
